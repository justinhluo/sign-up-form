# sign-up-form
This is a demo sign up form, part of The Odin Project cirriculum. Originally the structure of the form was made using flexbox. After learning about grid, I remade the form using this layout technique. It went much smoother since there are overlapping elements which grid handles nicely. Refer to the sign-up-form.png. I made it as close to identical as possible.
